## 🚀 Currently Working On

### 📊 MERN CRM Application
A production-style **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system built using the **MERN stack**, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Key features:**
- Role-based access control (**Admin / Employee**)
- JWT-based authentication (Register / Login / Logout)
- Admin can assign leads to employees
- Employees can:
  - View assigned leads
  - Edit leads
  - Add and manage follow-ups
- Full CRUD operations across modules
- Search, sort, and filter-enabled tables
- Modal-based UX for add/edit/delete actions
- Confirmation popups for destructive actions
- Frontend **input sanitization**
- Backend + frontend **field validation**
- Google Maps address autocomplete
